# django-airbrake



Django module for http://airbrake.io ...which works:)

I tried to use http://airbrake.io with one of my django projects. I found some modules around but all of them couldn't work with the latest airbrake API v3 so I decided to use on of existing modules https://github.com/darkman66/airbrake-django and adjust it to my needs and make it work ...finally :)


This module works as django middelware.
